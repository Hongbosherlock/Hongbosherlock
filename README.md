Hi there 👋

- 💼 LLM Inference Optimization Engineer at Baidu, focusing on **distributed serving** and **quantization**.
- 🛠 Stack: PyTorch, CUDA/CUTLASS, nsys/ncu
- 🧑‍💻  Open-source contributor: **SGLang / vLLM** — focusing on [PD disaggregation](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/6793) & [Quantization](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/8113).
- 📖 Selected posts: [DeepSeek FP8 Block-wise Quantization Explained](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/20269638568)
- 📷 Fun fact: I am an amateur photographer📷. My work can be found at: https://photo.leoneo.top
- 🤝 Always happy to collaborate on **LLM infra**: serving, kernels, quantization, and distributed inference.
